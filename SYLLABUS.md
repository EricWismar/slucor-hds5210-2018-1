## General Information
* _Meeting Time_: Mondays 6:00PM-9:00PM
* _Location_: Salus 1412D
* _Instructor_: Paul E. Boal
*  boalpe@slu.edu
*  314-598-5494
*  Office hours by appointment

## Course Overview
Students will be introduced to concepts in computer programming using the Python programming language. Students will learn to conceptualize steps required to perform a task, manipulate files, create loops, and functions. By the end of this course, students will have a basic understanding of computer programming, a working knowledge of the Python programming language, and they will be able to share their scripts to collaborate with other team members.

Upon completion of the course, students will:

1. Understand fundamental concepts in computer science.
2. Compose programs for data acquisition and processing with Python.
3. Collaborate and share scripts with other students.
4. Describe methods and communicate program purpose and usage to general audiences.

## Course Description
This is primarily a classroom-based lecture and workshop, with additional at-home and online readings, exercises, and exams. The course is designed to be a collaborative learning experience, and therefore requires active participation by all students.

### Course Elements
_Readings_: Text and supplementary readings should be completed by students prior to classroom sessions.

_Exercises (50%)_: Students will workshop example problems, analyses, and tasks with their instructor and classmates during class. Additional exercises will be assigned by the instructor during class to be completed at home. Both the in-class and take-home portions are to be submitted to the instructor prior to the start of class the following week. The nature of submission (eg via Blackboard, printed paper, GitHub, or web publishing) will vary depending on the nature of the assignment, and will be announced by the instructor at the time the assignment is given. There will be 15 of these assignments throughout the semester, each worth 3.3% of the final grade, for a total of 50% of the final grade.

_Exams (50%)_: Two take-home exams will be assigned to be completed during the University's scheduled mid-term and final exam weeks. Exam-week class-periods will be devoted to completion of these exams. Each of the 2 exams will be worth 25%, for a total of 50% of the final grade.

_Late work_: SLUCOR's policy is to not accept late work submissions. Students will generally not receive credit for late or missed assignments, however the instructor reserves the right to allow rare exceptions to this policy in extreme circumstances. If you believe that you can't meet an assignment's due date, please notify the instructor immediately.

_Attendance_: Due to the nature of the course structure, students are expected to attend every class period. For each absence, 5% will be deducted from the student's final grade.

_Grading_:

|                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| A  ≥ 92 – 100   | C+ ≥ 77 - <80   |
| A- ≥ 90 - <92   |	C  ≥ 72 - <77   |
| B+ ≥ 87 - <90   |	C- ≥ 70 - <72   |
| B  ≥ 82 - <87   | D  ≥ 60 - <70   |
| B- ≥ 80 - <82   |	F	 < 60         |

## Academic Integrity Policy
Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all endeavors. Saint Louis University is a community of learning in which integrity and mutual trust are vital. Since the mission of the University is "the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity," acts of falsehood violate its very reason for existence. They also demean and compromise the activities of teaching, research, health care and community service that are its primary mission. Since the University seeks to prepare students and faculty for lives of integrity and occupations of trust, it regards all acts of academic dishonesty as matters of serious concern. This policy was adopted Spring 2015; to access the full policy including definitions of violations, processes for reporting violations, sanctions, and appeals, please access the full policy at the Academic Affairs website
http://www.slu.edu/Documents/provost/academic_affairs/Universitywide%20Academic%20Integrity%20Policy%20FINAL%20%206-26-15.pdf

All students enrolled in SLUCOR courses are also expected to abide by and uphold the Saint Louis University Graduate School’s Policy on Academic Integrity and Ethics.  The 2004 edition of this policy is reprinted below and can be accessed at http://www.slu.edu/provost/Adobe%20Pages/Academic%20Integrity%20Policy.pdf.

The University is a community of learning; its effectiveness requires an environment of mutual trust and integrity.  As members of this community, students share with Faculty and Administrators the responsibility to maintain this environment.  Academic integrity is violated by any dishonesty in submitting for evaluation assignment's, tests, research, reports, etc., required to validate the student’s learning.  In a case of clear indication of such dishonesty, the Faculty member or Administrator has the responsibility to apply sanctions to protect the environment of integrity necessary for learning.

Although not all forms of academic dishonesty can here be listed, the instances listed below should be seen as actions that not only violate the mutual trust necessary between Faculty and students, but they also undermine the validity of the University's evaluation of students and take unfair advantage of fellow students.  Soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance in the completion of any work submitted toward academic credit is dishonest.

Examples of academic dishonesty would be copying from another student, copying from a book or class notes during a closed-book exam, submitting materials authored by or editorially revised by another person but presented as the student’s own work, copying a passage or text directly form a published source without appropriately citing/recognizing that source, taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work for another student, or securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the Instructor.

Any clear violation of academic integrity will be met with sanctions.  In a case of dishonesty within a course, the Instructor may assign an appropriate grade and /or recommend further sanctions to the Dean.  The Dean may, in a clearly serious instance of apparent or alleged academic dishonest, appoint and ad hoc committees to hear, judge, render an opinion, and, if warranted, recommend sanctions.  The Dean is responsible for the final decision and notifications of all associated parties.
